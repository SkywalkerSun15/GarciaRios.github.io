## Overview
 
My research investigates the formation and transformation of Latino identities  as well as the political implications of these transformations. I am currently working on a book manuscript exploring these dynamics with a multi-method approach. I use a unique repeated cross-sectional sample survey, taking advantage of the numerous individual observations within a specific cohort and time period, I employ a hierarchical age period cohort analysis (HAPC) in the form of cross-classified models in which observations across the different surveys are nested within time periods and cohorts.  Other academic interests include border issues and border research, and the politics of Mexico.
