# About

I was born and raised in Durango, Mexico but I consider El Paso, TX my second home, a fronterizo by choice. I am an Assistant Professor of Government and Latino Studies at Cornell University.

My research investigates the formation and transformation of Latino identities as well as the political implications of these transformations. I also examine voter turnout, political participation and public opinion, especially among Latino immigrants. Other academic interests include issues related to Latinos and the Voting Rights Act, border issues and border research, and the politics of Mexico.

I teach classes on immigration, race and ethnicity, latina/o politics, and social science methodology. For more detailed information please visit the CV and Research sections of this website.
